<h1>Hi, I'm Julie!<br>
Tech and People Professional</h1>

<h2>:wave: About Me</h2>

I am a tech and people enthusiast whose love lanuge includes supporting people - team members, customers, clients - to help them be able to do their job, do it well, 
and maybe most important, feel good about it! I have used my WordPress and tech skills in the online marketing arena for the past 10+ years and more recently have started
down the path of learning and understanding how this tech that I know and love works on a more basic level, including hardare, software, and operating systems.  It is my goal
to be able to empower and support others when it comes to using and troubleshooting the technology that they use day to day.
